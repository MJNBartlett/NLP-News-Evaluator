## Introduction

This repository is home to a web app, created as a project for Udacity.
You can find out more about the project below, or check out my profile for some other cool projects I'm working on.

## About this project
[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)

The project is built on a static template page provided by Udacity (this can be found in the resources section below).

The primary purpose of the project is to create a web app that utilises a Natural Language Processing *(NLP)* API call, on a user-provided URL. More specifically, the API called within this application is used for Sentiment Analysis, which is described by MeaningCloud:

>The text provided is analyzed to determine if it expresses a positive, neutral or negative sentiment (or if it is impossible to detect). In order to do so, the individual phrases are identified and the relationship between them is evaluated, which results in a global polarity value of the text as a whole.

>In addition to the local and global polarity, the API uses advanced natural language processing techniques to detect the polarity associated with both the entities and the concepts of the text. It also allows users to detect the polarity of entities and concepts they define themselves, which makes this tool applicable to any kind of scenario.

You can find more information on the [MeaningCloud website](https://www.meaningcloud.com/products/sentiment-analysis).

Following the API call, the information returned by the server is forwarded to the client, where it is either displayed to the user through an updated UI, or an appropriate error message is displayed.
